"""
Analyse a series of step-function images to recover distortion of the image

(c) Richard Bowman 2017, released under GNU GPL

This program expects as input an image containing a single black/white edge.  It will:
1. determine the direction (horizontal/vertical) and sign (black then white or white then black) of the edge
2. track the edge as it is scanned over the field of view
3. analyse the resultant grid of lines to determine the stage's step size and any distortion in the image

NB a 3-channel colour image is assumed.  Pad grayscale images to be n x m x 3 to avoid wierd results...
